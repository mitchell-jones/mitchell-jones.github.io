# Mitchell Jones: Data-Driven Nerd
I am a Business Analytics major at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. <br>
In addition to my undergraduate Business coursework, I currently serve as President of the Business Honors Program, and as a Data Analyst Intern for Visual Risk IQ. 
You can find more of my work on my Tableau Public Profile, [here!](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mitchell.jones#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0)

I am interested in Data Science Internships for the Summer of 2021 - connect with me [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchelljones49/)

## [Project 1: Linear Regression using Gradient Descent: Interactive Demo](https://github.com/mitchell-jones/lin-reg)
This is an interactive demo of of Linear Regression using the Gradient Descent algorithm.
User is asked to initialize a number of variables and then will be given opportunities to change learning rate & epochs to gain intuition about the effects that parameter tuning has on loss.

This algorithm is currently available for use through packages like sci-kit learn, but I decided to code it from scratch myself, to force myself to understand the underlying math.

Future goals for this project include compatibility with other types of Gradient Descent such as Stochastic Gradient Descent or Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.


## [Project 2: New York Police Salary Data - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/mitchell-jones/ny-police-data)
This notebook is intended as a exploration of various statistics and comparisons surrounding NY Police Officer & Police Department salaries from the years 2014 - 2019. Given recent events and discourse on social media platforms like Twitter, I found it pertinent to explore these statistics with the aim of answering various questions, including:

* How are Police Officers paid differently from other city employees?
* What departments of the city are paid the most?
* Do Police Officers receive Overtime Pay at higher rates, or as a percentage of their salary?

Additional questions may include salaries for Police Department Employees, rather than just Police officers.

## [Project 3: Made With ML 2020 Summer Incubator](https://github.com/mitchell-jones/DS-Incubator-2020)
This is a group project for the 2020 [Made With Machine Learning Summer Data Science Incubator](https://madewithml.com/programs/ds-incubator-summer-2020/). It is a team effort comprised of myself and Victor Zheng.

Our aim is to create a multi-faceted project through analysis of the MovieLens Dataset. Currently, this project is a work in progress, and will be developed over the course of the summer. 

This end-to-end project will explore popular Data Science topics including:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Text Classification
* Machine Learning / Predictive Modeling
* Movie Recommendation
* Text Generation
